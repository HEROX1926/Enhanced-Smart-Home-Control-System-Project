# Enhanced Smart Home Control System - C++ Project

The Enhanced Smart Home Control System is a console-based application developed in C++. It simulates the control and monitoring of various smart home devices, including lights, thermostats, and security cameras. This project showcases proficiency in object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, polymorphism, and data structures.
  
# Key Features:
  
  - Device Management: Add, remove, and list smart devices including lights, thermostats, and security cameras.
  - Device Control: Turn devices on/off, adjust thermostat temperature, and manage security camera settings.
  - Status Monitoring: Display the current status of all devices.
  - User Authentication: Basic user login system for security.
  
# Technical Skills Demonstrated:

  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism
  - Data Structures (vectors, shared pointers)
  - File I/O
  - Console-based UI design
  - User authentication
